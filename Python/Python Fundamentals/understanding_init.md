# Basic Usage

Let me explain __init__.py and its role in more detail:

In Python, when you have multiple .py files in a folder, you can treat that folder as a "package" that can be imported. 

But to make a folder into a proper Python package, it needs to have a special __init__.py file. 

This __init__.py file can run initialization code when the package is imported. It can also control what is imported from the package.

In this case, the folder contains:

- is_palindrome.py 
- main.py

To make it a package called "mypackage", we add a mypackage/__init__.py file.

Inside __init__.py we import the key functions we want to expose:

```python
# mypackage/__init__.py

from .is_palindrome import is_palindrome 
from .main import main
```

Now when we import mypackage, it will automatically import is_palindrome() and main() into the namespace:

```python
import mypackage

mypackage.is_palindrome("racecar") 
mypackage.main()
```

So in summary, __init__.py serves 2 purposes:

1. It denotes a folder as a Python package.

2. It allows initializing the package on import, like importing modules or setting up state.

Adding it helped organize the modules into a callable package. Let me know if this explanation helps or if you have any other questions!

# `__all__`

The __all__ variable in __init__.py serves a special purpose.

When you do:

```python
from mypackage import *
```

This imports all names from the mypackage namespace. 

By default, it would only import the names explicitly defined in __init__.py. 

But with __all__, we can control what gets imported with the * wildcard.

For example:

```python
# mypackage/__init__.py

__all__ = ["is_palindrome", "main"]

from .is_palindrome import is_palindrome
from .main import main
```

Now when we do:

```python 
from mypackage import *
```

It will import is_palindrome and main into the current namespace.

So __all__ explicitly defines the public interface of the package - the names that the package makes available when imported with * wildcard.

This is a good practice as it prevents cluttering the namespace with private modules/functions that shouldn't be directly imported.

The __all__ list contains just the public functions we want to expose from the mypackage package.

Hope this helps explain the purpose of __all__! Let me know if you have any other questions.
