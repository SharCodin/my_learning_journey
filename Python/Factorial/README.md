# Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer number is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to that number. It is denoted by the exclamation mark (!). For example:

`n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`

By definition, 0! is equal to 1. Here are some examples:

```text
1! = 1
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

Factorials are used in various mathematical and statistical calculations and are essential in solving problems in permutation, combination, and other areas of mathematics. Factorials grow rapidly, which means they become very large for relatively small input values. For instance, 20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000.
