# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple console-based game where the program randomly picks a number between 1 and 100 and the user has to guess what the number is. 

## How to Play

When you run the program, it will generate a random number between 1 and 100. It will not show you this number.

You will then be prompted to enter your first guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100. 

The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low. You want to try to guess the random number in as few attempts as possible.

Keep entering guesses until you guess the correct number. Once you guess the correct number, the game will tell you that you won and how many guesses it took you.

## Features

- Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 for each game
- Provides feedback if your guess is too high or too low
- Keeps track of and displays the number of guesses it took
- Handles invalid input gracefully - prompts again if non-number entered
- Simple console interface to play the game
